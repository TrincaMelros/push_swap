# libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions to use in all your other projects.

 This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all future C
projects.


The bonus functions are useful to manipulate linked lists, which will be useful in the future.
