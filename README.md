<h1 align="center"># push_swap</h1>

This program aims to sort a list of integers using only two stacks and a limited move set. It uses a simple algorithm to solve lists of numbers up to 5 elements, and a radix sort algorithm to solve lists bigger than that. Below is a gif of the program in action using a visualizer.
